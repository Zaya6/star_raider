# 1. Eterna

A world outside the human realm and in many ways, more than it. Eterna is a land of witches, faerie, and headless giants; wild and untamed by concrete slab or asphalt. Formed from a history seeped in myth and legend, when courageous few stood up against chaos to forever change the course of the Waters of Time. As does the water flow so does the hand of time, churning the tides of chaos and order that form the world. This is the story of a simple Star Shepard and how he lost his stars.

### 1.1.1. The Wondering Plains
They say one can get lost in the plains with a step, that only the winds know the way. That's not true, the Star Shepherds know too. Since before the creation of The Forge by the giants of old, the shepherds had made their home in the plains. Split among the three tribes, East, West, and North; the shepherds have herded their stars from the Crystal Springs and back. Gathering at the springs for rituals and Year Namings. The plains are home to a number of varied creatures, including the speedy grain runners who cover whole acres of land, stripping stalks of their seed.

### 1.1.2. The Shadow Crags
A dangerous place that only the Dying Witches dare go, or those who wish to buy their charms. Needless to say, many perish along the way. They call them the crags for the rocks that jut from the ground like teeth and shadow for the blanket like shade that covers them. Make sure to bring a light for the whispers one hears within promise many terrible things. 

### 1.1.3. The Splintered Woods
Home of the Weavers and filled with as much mystery as they. None remember how the ground became cracked with chasms. The entire wood is covere with crevices, like dry mud baked under a hot sun, and deep enough that not even light returns. To cross one must find secret bridges that only the weavers know, or chance the vines and put ones life on a line. 

### 1.1.4. The Forge
Once a great tower stood on this rocky ground, stretching high into the sky to touch the heavens. And as wide at its base as the distance a grain runner could race in a day. It was home of the giants and of their crystal forges, where they crafted the finest goods of the land. Until day when their debts were dropped and their tower was topped, much like the giants with their heads.

### 1.1.5. The Crystal Springs 
The springs of Eterna sprout forth all manner of life. The waters here are at their purest and animate even the dust of the ground. It is because of the Crystal Springs that Eterna exists and not even the Gamer questions their importance.

## 1.2. The Races of Eterna

The springs of Eterna have given rise to a stew of races and magical beings.  

### 1.2.1. The Star Sheperds
The first among all are the mysterious Star Shepards, who guide the stars through the waters of time. One of the oldest races, the Star Shepards serve an important role in the life cycle of Eterna. Along with their personal flocks, which their harvest their all important star dust from. Importantly, they also guide their old and dying stars back to the core of Eterna, to the great forge of the giants where they're burned to keep all of creation alive.

Of note is their star dust which combined with plant matter forms the entirety of their diet. When woven with ancient symbols, it may be used to create miracles of power that even the Dying Witches envy. 

*Usually found in the Wondering Plains*

### 1.2.2. The Giants
The next beings to rise from the springs were the giants of Eterna. Strong and hulking, the giants were at one time reknown craftsmen. But following an event forgotten millenia ago, the famed giants lost their heads in a bet with the Gamer. Without their minds to guide them, the giants became rabid and merged with the wild elements of the land, trees, fire, beasts, and stone. Now their giant masses strike fear into the hearts of all of Eterna. The giants no longer control a portion of the land and can be found in most locations.

### 1.2.3. The Dying Witches
Haggard and old, the dying witch cares only about her beauty and staying off the inevitability of old age. It is said they will pay hansomly for any new balm or cream that may smooth their ragged skin, even if it is fake. Despite the obsession, they are seen as being the ugliest of the races. Scars from years of experimental make-up has left them twisted and deformed. However they are highly regarded for their wisdom and stories. They are keepers of stories afterall with a memory that touches the edge of time.

*located in the shadow crags*

### 1.2.4. The Weavers
Sporting six arms, the weavers are an elegant if lonesome race of people. They can take many forms since their flesh is made from the same yarn they famously use to weave. Because of this, there are no sexes of weavers. When a child is desired, one is simply weaved into existence by another. 

For that fact alone one would assume they would be the most populous race. And they probably would if not for the secretivive nature of the yarn they use. Only a select few of their race know how to create it and the process said to last lifetimes.

*Located at the Splintered Woods*

### 1.2.5. The Faerie
Mischievious little people who hate to be seen. Though small in stature, they are gifted with a big voice, which they often use to play tricks on other races. They are reknown for stealing snacks or shiny objects from travelers, but run away quickly if looked at. Faerie are probably the most featured race in all Eterna lore and are even mention during creation. A famous story that's told every year is of the laywaying of the Aldro, Lyt of The North. For six months the foolish Lyt hid in a cave, believing his camp was occupied by highwaymen. He emerged to find it all a trick by Faeries who did naught but steal all of their undergarments.

*Found anywhere in wilderness*
