# The Races of Eterna

The springs of Eterna have given rise to a stew of races and magical beings.  

## The Star Shepards
The first among all are the mysterious Star Herders, who guide the stars through the waters of time. One of the oldest races, the Star Shepards serve an important role in the life cycle of Eterna. Along with their personal flocks, which their harvest their all important star dust from. Importantly, they also guide their old and dying stars back to the core of Eterna, to the great forge of the giants where they're burned to keep all of creation alive.

Of note is their star dust, which combined with plant matter forms the entirety of their diet. But when woven with ancient symbols, it may be used to create miracles of power that even the dying witches envy.

## The Giants
The next beings to rise from the springs were the giants of etenia. Strong and hulking, the giants were at one time reknown craftmen. But following an event forgotten millenia ago, the famed giants lost their heads. Without their minds to guide them, the giants became rabid and merged with the wild elements of the land, trees, fire, beasts, and stone. Now their giant masses strike fear into the hearts of all of Eterna. 

The giants no longer control a portion of the land and can be found in most locations.

##  The Dying Witches
Haggard and old, the dying witch cares only about her beauty and staying off the enevitability of old age. 

##  The Weavers
Sporting six arms, the weavers are an elegant if lonesome race of people. They can take many forms since their flesh is made from the same yarn they famously use to weave. Because of this, there are no sexes of weavers. When a child is desired, one is simply weaved into existence by another. 

For that fact alone one would assume they would be the most populous race. And they probably would if not for the secretivive nature of the yarn they use. Only a select few of their race know how to create it and the process said to last lifetimes.
