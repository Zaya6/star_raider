# 1. The Story

## 1.1. Act 1
Nova tends the flocks of his father while Bubo chastises him for not paying attention. After some quick dialog an earthquake happens and the churning earth separates Nova and Bubo from his father's flock. 

Nova navigates a changed Eterna to find his way back home. [The self learning phase of intro levels]

Upon arriving back at the yurts of his tribe, he finds everything in disarray and many in mourning. Asking a tribesman reveals that his father was hurt in a fall during the earthquake and is mortally wounded. 

Bubo directs him to go to his father's yurt fast.

When he arrives a cutscene plays with dialog of his father. It goes as well as talking to any distant father goes in real life. At the end his father is heartbroken over the loss of his tribe's stars and falls into unconsciousness. 

Outside the Yurt, Stella confronts Nova, she's angry with him but directs Nova to have courage and restore their family's herds. If their herds had not been lost they could of created medicine combining concentrated star dust and time water to heal the Lyt. He must return to the ancient practice of star raiding to find their lost stars. She will help him in secret.

After the cutscene Bubo shows the world map to Nova and explains basically how it works. She expresses concern that traveling to the different regions could take years. She says she has something in mind to accomplish that faster but says she'll bring it up later. Until then she directs Nova to begin star raiding within their own land, the western plains. 

-*After the player has recovered 5 stars Bubo initiates another dialog*

She says she has figured out their problem with traveling and that they need to travel to the Shadow Crags to talk to Old Nan. This begins a series of levels that the player must traverse to reach Old Nan's castle. 

Once they reach the castle Bubo and Old Nan immediately begin bickering but ultimately Bubo convinces her sister to give Nova the Parallax Gem to quick travel to the different regions of Eterna. 

The world screen opens up and Bubo shows the new regions open to them. Except a few that require permission from certain leaders to star raid into. The Forge she tells the player is off limits for now because the Gamer is a dangerous and mischievous character.

## 1.2. Act 2
The player will spend most of their time traveling and recovering stars. At this point the game world opens up, except for The Forge. The story plays out through the individual quests for each region.

-*After the player has roughly recovered half of their stars, Nova receives an invitation from The Gamer*

Nova goes to The Forge's special map against Bubo's warnings and meets with the gamer. The gamer has heard of the trouble of the Western Tribe. He offers to help the player in exchange for a simple game of tumbles. He will give access to his region for raiding if you win, but will take the role of Lyt of your tribe if you lose. Losing means game over. 

1. If Nova refuses, the Gamer won't budge but allows Nova to change his mind. The player may go to Old Nan to seek out her advice. She reveals that she knows where he keeps his humility. *(Note, the player is not directed to do this. They must discover this path on their own.)*
   + This gives the option to do a special level within the forge. At the end you must play a game of tumbles and win against a stone statue to enter a chamber that has a glowing flask with the Gamer's humility.
   + Nova travels back to the Gamer and releases the Gamer's humility. The Gamer goes insane over guilt for his crimes and teleports away screaming.
   + Nova gains access to The Forge
2. If Nova plays, he loses because the Gamer cheats. (Duh!) The Gamer moves into the Giant Yurt while his father is unconscious. The people of Nova's tribe are distraught and blame Nova. Stella implores Nova to seek out Old Nan for advice.
    + The Quest-line for #1 above begins except now Nova confronts the Gamer at his tribe's camp.
  
## 1.3. Act 3

After the player has recovered all their stars, Stella comes to Nova and tells him it's time to heal his father. But he must take their stars to the center of the Crystal Springs in a special level that only becomes available at this point. In order to accomplish this Nova must take 10 stars at a time through multiple maps to the springs. Nova must protect the stars on the way to succeed and make multiple runs. *Note, each time Nova moves away from a map the enemies reappear.*

If he succeeds Stella meets him at the spring and a cutscene plays. Nova uses some witchcraft like stuff with the stars in the spring and creates a potion that they feed to their unconcious Lyt. He wakes up and is super groggy. They promise to tell him the whole story once they return to their camp. The Great Lyt uses his herding staff and directs all the stars to fly into the sky. Him, Stella, and Nova ride on flying stars back to their camp.

## 1.4. Epilogue 
Nova's father is standing by the time water looking lonesomely into the horizon. If Nova talks to him his father, though distant, expresses gratitude to Nova and awkwardly tells him he loves him. Stella overhears and teases him. Griff blushes at but then embraces his son and tells him he'll be a great Lyt some day.
