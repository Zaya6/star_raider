# Characters of Star Raider

## Nova
Nova is a young star shepard and son of the Great Lyt of the western plains. This isn't much to Nova yet, his story is just beginning.

## Bubo
Nova's owl companion with the face of a woman. Bubo was originally a dying witch before she was cast out and cursed to take the form of a fowl. With magic cut off from her by the lack of fingers to draw the ancient symbols. For some time she wondered Eterna before being captured with a net by Nova's father, Griff, Lyt of the Western Plains Tribe. Star Shepard nomads who live in yurts and travel with the current of the waters of time. With her face and crafty tongue intact, she conviced the great Lyt to release her under the promise of serving as his advisor. A position she would hold for decades until the birth of his son Nova, whom she was directed to gaurd and educate. 

## Griff, Great Lyt of the Western Plains

## Saccular, the Gamer
More ancient than the oldest of tales, the Gamer is perhaps the most deadly and michievious character to live on Eterna. It is said he once cheated himself of his own humility in a game of cards.

But none know definitly what came to them. Whispers on the wind say he cheated each and every one of his kin of their foresight. Robbed of their ability to plan ahead, he continually tricked them into more games, stealing from them every disirable aspect until they became the beasts of the land. The ruins they left behind stand as a reminder of what they once were, and the dangers of a simple bet.

However, towards the shepards she shows a rare kindness that few others see.
