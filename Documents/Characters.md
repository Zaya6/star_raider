# 1. Characters of Star Raider

## 1.1. Nova
Nova is a young star shepard and son of the Great Lyt of the western plains. This isn't much to Nova yet, his story is just beginning.

## Stella
Nova's excitable and adventurous cousin. She helps him on his adventures by periodically giving him star dust to replenish his magic, or Time Crystals to increase his HP.

## 1.2. Bubo
Nova's owl companion with the face of a woman. Bubo was originally a dying witch before she was cast out and cursed to take the form of a fowl. With magic cut off from her by the lack of fingers to draw the ancient symbols. For some time she wondered Eterna before being captured with a net by Nova's father, Griff, Lyt of the Western Plains Tribe. Star Shepard nomads who live in yurts and travel with the current of the waters of time. With her face and crafty tongue intact, she conviced the great Lyt to release her under the promise of serving as his advisor. A position she would hold for decades until the birth of his son Nova, whom she was directed to gaurd and educate. 

## 1.3. Griff, Great Lyt of the Western Plains
Nova's father and Lyt of his tribe. None know how old this great shepard is, but it is said that he battled the giants during their fall and ultimate ruin. During a mysterious earthquake at the start of our story Aldro falls and mortally wounds himself.

## 1.4. Saccular, the Gamer
More ancient than the oldest of tales, the Gamer is perhaps the most deadly and michievious character to live on Eterna. It is said he once cheated himself of his own humility in a game of cards. Much of him is unknown, including his race, which doesn't appear to be any of the typical races in Eterna. Hiroglyphs say that he was once part of a great people. A race of builders. But none know definitly what came to them. Whispers on the wind say he cheated each and every one of his kin of their foresight. Robbed of their ability to plan ahead, he continually tricked them into more games, stealing from them every disirable aspect until they became the beasts of the land. The ruins they left behind stand as a reminder of what they once were, and the dangers of a simple bet.

## 1.5. Old Nan
One of the wisest of the dying witches. She's particularly well known in Nova's tribe for the trove of stories she brings to their Year Namings. She is an old friend of Griff and has told many stories of their exploits together. Her and her sister Bubo have a long history together as bitter rivals and Bubo blames Old Nan for the fate that ultimately befell her. However, towards the shepards she shows a rare kindness that few others see.

Throughout the game, the player may return to Old Nan to get advice or buy potions and scrolls.

## 1.6. Nimrod, Great Lyt of the Eastern Plains
Nimrod is a great hunter and his exploits are depicted in many myths and tales. However he is very secretive and does not like being asked many questions, to the frustration of fans who desire all the tasty details of his life. He has a bit of a rockstar persona and is well known throughout Eterna. A Nimrod signature is highly coveted and can fetch a pretty penny.

## 1.7. Aldro, Great Lyt of the Northern Plains
The hippie Lyt, who sits by the fire all day singing songs with his lute like instrument. He doesn't have a great Yurt and prefers to sleep outside under the stars. He talks in riddles and is never forthcoming with info nomatter how important it is.

## 1.8. Textor, The Great Loom of the Weavers
The Loom of the weavers, she is very thoughtful and caring with centuries of wisdom to draw from. She is constantly weaving new things for the world. Like other weavers her skin is luminescent and textured in the style of weaves they use. She has large eyes that are almost doll-like. She grants Nova access to weaver lands for star raiding on condition that he retreive their yarn which has been stolen.
