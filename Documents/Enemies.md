# 1. The Enemies of Eterna

Enemies are broken up into two types for simplicity. Regular and Giants. Giants have very special moves and more HP, which makes them kind of like mini-bosses.

Enemies are separated between the many regions of Eterna. Though for ease of development reusing enemies in different regions is encouraged.
